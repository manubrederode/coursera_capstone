# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Winning Space Race with Data Science

## Overview
This project is part of the IBM Data Science Certification program - Coursera/IBM Applied Data Science Capstone.

The commercial space age is here; several companies such as Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX are making space travel affordable for everyone. Among all of them, SpaceX perhaps stands out as the most successful. One reason behind SpaceX's success is that the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive thanks to the reusability of the first stage--which is the most expensive part of a rocket launcher that carries most of the work. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. In this project, our job will be to determine the price of each launch which depends on whether the first stage would land successfully to be reused. Using machine learning models and public data on Falcon 9, we will predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Spaces Xâ€™s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets.
